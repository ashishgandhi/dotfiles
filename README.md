# Introduction

The goal is to be able to set up a new macOS device without needing access to an already set up device.
You may have lost your old device, not want “cruft” from it, or want to set up a new device for work.

# Instructions

Since reloading the shell is not reliable mid-script the setup is broken into two steps.

1. Set up the shell by running `shell.sh`.
2. Relaunch the shell and run `apps.sh`.
